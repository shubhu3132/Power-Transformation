# Power-Transformation

Optimising the linear regression model on a dataset of concrete where 
different attributes (Independent Varibales) predict the resultant 
Strength(Dependent Variable)  based on 9 Columns where first we 
predicted without applying  power transformer to the columns and 
then predicted and improved the model predictions by using Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformation
